# Detecting Bots on Twitter Using Machine Learning

A Twitter bot is a software program designed for generating automated posts, following Twitter users, or engaging in spam activities to attract clicks on the Twitter microblogging service. In our project, we utilized Machine Learning techniques to discern whether a Twitter account is authentic or a bot. Extensive feature engineering and extraction were undertaken, where we carefully selected a subset of 20 features crucial for identifying bot accounts. While experimenting with various algorithms, we eventually developed our own, achieving an impressive Area Under the Curve (AUC) score exceeding 90%.
